# News Site (First ever coding project HTML + CSS webpage)
This projects' aim was to build a new site from scratch and it being responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop.
The website is the first ever coding project. 

## The problem
In the beginning I started coding and designing the layout for desktop - however, half way in I realized that I should have started with the mobile view. Getting the different responsive views to look OK in grid was the biggest challenges I faced. During the project, I've learnt a lot regarding grids and responsiveness, and if I were to do it all over - it would be so much faster and smoother.
