# News Site (First ever coding project)
This projects' aim was to build a new site from scratch and it being responsive for mobile, tablet and desktop.
The website is the first ever project. 

## The problem
In the beginning I started coding and designing the layout for desktop - however, half way in I realized that I should have started with the mobile view. Getting the different responsive views to look OK in grid was the biggest challenges I faced. During the project, I've learnt a lot regarding grids and responsiveness, and if I were to do it all over - it would be so much faster and smoother. The navbar in the mobile view doesn't look so good, originally I wanted a dropdown menu and I'm imagining that's what it'll look like when it's expanded ;-)
